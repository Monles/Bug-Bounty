# Intro
Bug bounty programs often fall somewhere on the spectrum between black box and gray box testing ([Hacking APIs](https://nostarch.com/hacking-apis), 2022).

Bug bounty programs offer a structured yet flexible testing environment. Hunters have enough information to guide their efforts efficiently (gray box elements) while still working from an external perspective without full access to the internal workings of the application (black box elements).
